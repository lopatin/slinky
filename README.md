#Slinky

Slinky is a static file server designed to make development of static
web sites and applications simpler. Simply run slinky in the home
directory of your app and it will serve while compiling things like
SASS, HAML and CoffeeScript on the fly.

To get it, just `gem install slinky`. Note that this is unstable, not well 
tested, and hardly feature-complete. It may, however, be useful.
